Collection of methods for Time Series analysis

Methods implemented:

    acf:        Auto-correlation or auto-covariance of a univariate serie. 
    ccf:        Cross-correlation or cros-covariance of two univariate series.
    d:          Lagged differences of a given order for Vector, Array and TimeSeries.
    loess:      Locally weighted smoothed series.
    sma:        Simple moving average.
    stl:        Seasonal and Trend decomposition using loess.
