# Forecast [![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://viraltux.github.io/Forecast.jl/stable)

Julia package containing utilities intended for Time Series analysis.

> :warning: This package is in an early development stage and its functionality has not been thoroughly tested. Please, consider to report issues if you find any.

## Methods

* Auto-correlation/covariance function
* Cros-correlation/covariance function
* Henderson moving average filter
* Lagged differences (and inverse) of a given order
* Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
* Partial Auto-correlation function (stepwise and real)
* Seasonal and Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL)
* Simple Moving Average

There are also customized plots for methods returning CCF and STL objects.
